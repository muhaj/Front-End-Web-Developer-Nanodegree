First of all Congratulation! Geting stuck is part of the learning process, actually is the phase when you learn and experience the most of it. What now?

Never give up! You will encounter many problems when you’re coding. All developers do, so be patient. Developers are tenacious problem solvers, and they don’t stop just because something doesn’t work the first time through.
A sign of a good developer is someone who is going to solve problems and persevere. You're going to run into problems, you're going to get frastureted, :disappointed: there will be times where you are confused.:tired_face: Whenever you run into these situation it's important that you keep going, not in a sense to continue to get more frastureted,i mean going in a sense that day after day, little by little you just make some progress. That's how you can get through any problem.

Programming requires a lot more creativity than you might initially assume. Thinking outside the box is important for finding new ideas to solve current problems.

There are many ways to solve a puzzle, so just because something didn’t work as expected, it doesn’t mean the puzzle is impossible to solve.
