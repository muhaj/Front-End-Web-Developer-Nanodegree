###  First of all Congratulation!:clap: 
Geting stuck is part of the learning process, actually is the phase when you learn and experience the most of it. What now?

**Never give up!** You will encounter many problems when you’re coding. All developers do, so be patient. Developers are tenacious problem solvers, and they don’t stop just because something doesn’t work the first time through.
A sign of a good developer is someone who is going to solve problems and persevere. 
>You're going to run into problems, you're going to get frustrated, :disappointed: there will be times where you are confused.:tired_face: 

Remember is natural, and it happens to the best of the developers.

>You are not really wrong you're just not right **yet**.
So don't let it get to you!

Whenever you run into these situation it's important that you keep going, not in a sense to continue to get more frustrated, i mean going in a sense that day after day, little by little you just make some progress. That's how you can get through any problem.

Programming requires a lot more creativity than you might initially assume. Thinking outside the box is important for finding new ideas to solve current problems.

There are many ways to solve a puzzle, so just because something didn’t work as expected, it doesn’t mean the puzzle is impossible to solve. 

### To help out here are a few problem solving strategies when things get difficult.


*  *Stand up put down whatever project you are stuck in and take a break, go for sleep or walk away. You'll be surprized how much easier the problem will get when you return and you'll be feeling more inspired and calm.*


*  *You also have Stack Overflow and Google, research read other people code, docs and tutorials. Most of the times your errors will have messages, copy the message and google it, you'll be surprized how quickly you can get answers to your questions.*


*  *Focus and avoid distractions. The fact that you are interested in code means that you are interested in a lot of things, it's normal to get distracted, so try to avoid it by closing the other pages, email or social networks.*


*  *Ask Questions! Try to reach out for help on the developer community. You aren't alone, there probably a lot of others developers that are learning along side and got stuck in the same situation as you. So go Ask and find out how did they solve the problem.*
              -  Stack Overflow
              -  Udacity forums
              -  Google


*  *Rethink of what you're doing. Write down your ideas on a paper and try to build a solving strategic plan. But when you do, you'll do so with new knowledge, new understanding, and new experiences to make your next solving plan even sharper.*


*  *Break the project into tiny pieces, then solve a small piece. Once you get started writing something that is working is much easier to keep going.*


Whatever you do, try not to get too stressed out about the learning process. You have an ultimate goal and you should always keep that in mind. And remember that having fun in the short-term goes a long way, so always try to find some enjoyment in what you you’re learning.

###  There where lots of types of goals that i had in my mind, but this [four step exercise article from Udacity blog][1], helped me norrow down my goals to 3 specific main goals.


1. > To become a Front-End Developer at [Media Monks][2] or a similar company.


2. > Geting a CS Master Degree from [Georgia Tech University online MOOC.][3]


3. > My own start up idea that i have, and want to build.


###  I have identify the paths to my goals, i've done the research, and i know how to accomplish my sub-goals. I have considered my situation, my background, my abilities, and the constraints that are specific to my needs. The fact that i'm writing this project it means that i'm on the right path of my goals.
