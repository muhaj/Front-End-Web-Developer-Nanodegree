#Project Overview

Hey there, web developer! Congratulations on making it this far! Here's your next project: __translating a mockup to HTML__. This is similar to the exercise from earlier in the problem set, except this article is going to be a bit more complicated. I'll be giving you a mockup of a website (and a copy of the text in it). It's going to be your job to recreate it with HTML.

You're going to see some formatting you haven't encountered before, so you'll need to use a resource, like the MDN element reference, to research new elements.

#Project Instructions

1. Download and unzip mockup-to-article.zip from the downloadables section. You'll find index.html, the article mockup image (blog-mockup.png) and a file called reflections.txt inside.

2. Use what you've learned about web development so far to edit index.html so that it looks exactly like the mockup image. You will need to use new elements, which means that you'll need to research and experiment! (Hint: look up "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough.")

3. When you've finished building the article, open up reflections.txt. You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development in reflections.txt. Answer the following questions:

  - What new skills have you learned?

  - What has been easy?

  - What has been difficult?

  - How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


#Project Submission

Take a moment to double check that your index.html file renders exactly like the mockup!
Make sure you've answered all the questions for the reflection. Feel free to use your native language! Graders will translate if necessary.
Check your project against the rubric.
Create and submit a zip file containing index.html and reflections.txt.
Good luck! I know that you can do it ðŸš€
