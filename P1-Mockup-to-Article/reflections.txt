You've learned a lot about web development so far. 
I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 
Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?
  
   
    - While i was researching and experimenting on "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough," 
      i found and started to learn about new elements like forms, interactive elements, and web components.

* What has been easy?


    - Basic HTML elements, sectioning, text content, and metadata, most of them i had encountered before
      and are easy to remember.

* What has been difficult?
  

    - Some elements in forms, inline text semantics, and interactive elements where hard to remember.
      Also what i think is a little bit difficult to learn but beautiful in the same time, is to define
      new types of HTML elements "custom elements."

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


    - I used google to research for elements, resource like the MDN element reference website, 
      tutorials like html5rocks, and tools like codepen.io to test and experiment with the new tags elements.
      By using the skills, resources, tools, and a growth mindset, i have embraced and overcome every challanges so far.
